## Analysis and recommendation for Des Moines
Des Moines is facing a few challenges to implement a Citi Bike system like the one in New York:

A much lower population density which increase the distance and make biking more challenging
A higher rate of car ownership and less develop transit system which can make it difficult for commuters to switch for driving to biking.

One solution will be to create all the  bike stations in the downtown area. 

## Tableau story

### Des Moines demographics:
Almost 70% of Des Moines demographics is between 18 to 65 years old, as noted in a previous study from NYC Citi bike people under 35 years are using more biked for a longer time. 
The city is almost equality divided between men and women. Men tend to use the bikes more. 

###Des Moines Transit system :
The amount of time people spent going to work (19 minutes) is relatively low, households have between on and 2 cars, the transit system is very scarce outside of the downtown area. 
This is make difficult to have bike station outside of the center of the city. 

### Des Moines and NYC Population
We compared the size and density of the population between NYC and DesMoines. 
Des Moines population density is 10 time smaller which will represent a huge challenge for a Citi Bike system like the one in New York.
